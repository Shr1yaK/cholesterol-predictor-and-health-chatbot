# Cholesterol Predictor & Health Chatbot

This project was developed during a summer internship at Emirates Aviation University to explore how machine learning and conversational interface can assist in early health screening and awareness.

## Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases are increasing worldwide, with high cholesterol levels being a common risk factor. Early detection through prediction of cholesterol levels can aid in preventive health care. Additionally, providing accessible health information via a conversational chatbot can enhance user engagement and awareness.

## Aim

- To develop a multiple linear regression model that predicts cholesterol levels based on age, blood pressire, and heart rate, enabling early health screening.
- To create an interactive health chatbot that provides users with factual health information, such as lifestyle advice related to conditions like high blood pressure.

## Overview

This project combines data-driven machine learning with conversational AI to support early health screening and awareness related to cardiovascular risks.

The first component is a multiple linear regression model that predicts an individual's cholesterol based on easily measurable health indicators such as age, blood pressure, and heart rate.

The second component is a health chatbot designed as an interactive conversational interface. It provides users with factual health information, such as recommended exercises for specific conditions like high blood pressure. Additionally, the chatbot includes a hospital locator feature that allows users to find and view hospitals on a map within a specified city.

By integrating these components, the project aims to empower users with accessible health information and resources, potentially aiding early detection and prevention of cholesterol-related diseases.

## Features

- **Cholesterol Prediction Model**: Uses multiple linear regression to estimate a user's cholesterol level based on age, blood pressure, and heart rate.
- **Interactive Health Chatbot**: Answers factual health-related questions (e.g., lifestyle changes for high blood pressure).
- **Hospital Locator**: When asked, the chatbot shows hospitals in any specified city plotted on a map.
- **User-Friendly Jupyter Notebooks**: Organized into separate notebooks for visualization and chatbot development.
- **Clean Data Visualizations**: Includes seaborn/matplotlib charts that explore correlations in the dataset.
